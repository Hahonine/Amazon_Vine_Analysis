# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
- We are running this analysis to determine if the Vine program produces helpful reviews without bias.
- We examined video game reviews from Amazon.com.

## Results
- There were a total of 40,565 reviews with 20 or more helpful votes.
- Of those, 15,711 were 5-star reviews
- Of the 5-Star reviews, only 48 came from the Vine program.
- 15,663 5-Star reviews came from people reviewing outside of the Vine program.
- Only slightly more than 0.3% were from the Vine program, where a whopping 99.6% were not.

## Summary
- The Vine program appears to have triggered suspicion in the people reading the reviews. With such a low percentage of Vine 5-Star reviews being rated helpful, it seems the program had the opposite of it's intended result.
- There is most likely a bias introduced by thr Vine program, just not the bias that a product producer would want to have associated with thir product.
